ABOUT ROBERT TERRY

Section Title
A Solo Specialist for Complex Enterprises

Content (first-person)
I am Robert Terry. For over 17 years, I’ve worked at the intersection of business operations and Microsoft technology.

My approach is direct: identify friction in your data processes and engineer systems that remove it. I focus on stability, clarity, and logic — not overengineering or unnecessary complexity.

When you hire me, you are not getting a programmer. You are getting a principal consultant who understands how your data systems should support your business.
